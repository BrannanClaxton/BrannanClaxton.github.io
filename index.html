      As the internet continues to grow in popularity, it's important for everyone to have their own webpage!  It can have many functions, such as a
      personal page with links to your favorite websites, a blog for keeping family members up-to-date with your life, an advertising page for your
      product or service, or more!  There are tons of options for website design and hosting, but my personal preference is hosting with GitHub.
    </p>
    <p>
      This guide is specifically for people who know how to create a webpage, but don't know how or where to put it on the internet for everyone to access.
      If you don't know how to begin writing code to create a webpage in HTML, you might want to practice building webpages on your local device before
      attempting to upload it for the world to see.

    <h1>Step 1: Create a GitHub account</h1>
    <img src="images/Github Login.png" alt= "Sign up form"></img>
    <h2><em>If you already have a GitHub account, feel free to move on to Step 2</em></h2>
    <p class = "smush">
      GitHub is one of the leading sites in sharing code and software projects.  It makes it easy to collaborate with others and work as a team.  Anyone
      can sign up and use the service for free.  In addition, one of the services it offers is free hosting for one webpage per user.  This means that, as
      long as you have a GitHub account, you can host a website.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1.1: First, go to <strong><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.</a></strong></li>
      <li>Step 1.2: Next, click the "Sign Up" button on the top right of the page</li>
      <ul>
        <li>You should see something like the image to the right:</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Step 1.3: Fill in the information and click the "Create Account" button at the bottom of the sign-up page</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Make sure your username is something memorable, because it will eventually be part of the URL to your site!</li>
        <li>You have now created a GitHub account!  There are other options to play around with, such as adding information to your profile, but
        for now let's move on!</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h1>Step 2: Download and install the GitHub desktop application</h1>
    <h2><em>Skip this step if you already have the GitHub app installed</em></h2>
    <p class = "smush">The GitHub app allows for you to interface directly from your computer to the GitHub website without having to use a browser.  The application can
      then interact with the files on your local machine, so that you can work on your webpage files and then use the desktop application to push the changes
      out at your leisure
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 2.1: Go to <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">this</a> website and click the purple "download" button.  After it's finished downloading, run the
        file</li>
      <li>Step 2.2: Log into your GitHub account through the application.  If you already have file repositories, they should show up under the "current repository"
        tab on the upper-left of your window</li>
      <ul>
        <li>After the installation is complete, you can ignore the application for a little while.  We won't need it again until you're ready to
        publish something!</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h1>Step 3: Create a Webpage Repository</h1>
    <h2><em>Skip to this step if you already have a GitHub account AND you've installed the GitHub desktop app!</em></h2>
    <p class = "smush">
      A "repository" is basically a virtual space for storing files.  Files stored in the repository can be viewed, added to, or removed.  Other users
      can also be given certain permissions, which allows them to manage the files in your repository.  While you can store files of most types in
      a repository, we will only be creating a repository for our webpage files and the resources we want on the page, such as images.  There is a
      specific set of steps in creating a repository that gets recoginzed by GitHub as a website to be hosted, so make sure you follow the steps.
    </p>
    <img class = "tiny" src="images/create repository.png" alt= "Toolbar"></img>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 3.1: In any part of the GitHub website, look at the top right of the page.  There should be three icons:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A bell shaped icon where notifications pop up</li>
          <li>A plus sign with a tiny arrow beside it.</li>
          <li>A circle with another arrow beside it for navigating your personal profile</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Step 3.2: Click the plus sign</li>
    </ul>
    <img style = "width: 30%;height: 50%" src="images/repo.png" alt= "Repository Screen"></img>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 3.3: From the drop-down menu, click "New Repository" at the top</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Now you're at the "Create a new repository" page.  You should see something like the image to the right:</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Step 3.4: Set "Owner" to your username</li>
      <li>Step 3.5: Now, name your repository ((your username)).github.io</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This step is <strong>VERY IMPORTANT!</strong></li>
        <li>Your repository name <strong>MUST</strong> follow this
          formula: ((your username)).github.io</li>
        <li>Make sure you replace "((your username))" with the username tied to your account</li>
        <li>If your repository name doesn't follow this rule, it will be saved as a personal repository and not a webpage repository</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <img style = "width: 30%;height: 50%" src="images/readme.png" alt= "Other options"></img>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Since my GitHub username is "BrannanClaxton," my webpage's repository
        name AND url is <Strong>BrannanClaxton.github.io</strong> (come visit if you want!)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Step 3.6: Check the box for "Add a README file"</li>
      <li>Step 3.7: Finally, hit the green "Create Repository" button at the bottom</li>
      <ul>
        <li>This is your brand new repository! Does it have that new car smell?  This is an online storage space
        for all your  HTML & CSS code, images, files, and any other resources that are packaged into your page.
        all updates to your webpage must be sent to this space to be included</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h1>Step 4: Combine it all</h1>
    <p class = "smush">
      We're almost done!  This tutorial isn't meant to leave you with a finished, professional website (though it could), but instead show you
      how to take a webpage and put it somewhere accessible from a tablet, computer, phone, or Tesla!  Some of you may already have a beautiful
      website complete but just needed a way to host it, in which case you are about to be able to relax!  However, I suspect that most
      people do not have a finished webpage just waiting around, and that this guide is just the first step.  Either way, by the end of the
      tutorial, you will have created a GitHub account, a webpage repository, and a way to link your local webpage files to the hosting site.
      I think that's still pretty impressive!
    </p>
      <img style = "width: 30%;height: 50%" src="images/app.png" alt= "GitHub Desktop App"></img>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 4.1: Check that your new webpage repository is showing up in your list of repositories on the GitHub desktop application</li>
      <li>Step 4.2: Navigate to it.  If done correctly, your window should look like this:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Remember, your repository <strong>should</strong> be named ((your username)).github.io</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Step 4.3: Next, you must open your repository in your preferred external IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  If you don't have one, it might
        be time to start shopping around.  There are a ton of options, and most should work with the GitHub application, but the one I use for
        creating webpages in HTML & CSS is Atom.</li>
      <li>Step 4.4: If you have an external IDE installed, click the button next to "Open the repository in your external editor."  The button should have
        "Open in ((your IDE name))."  This button will send you to that IDE and open the repository for editing</li>
    </ul>
    <img style = "width: 30%;height: 50%" src="images/atom.png" alt= "Repository in Atom"></img>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 4.5: Create a "main page" file named "index".  This lets the GitHub repository know that this is the page your site will
        open to</li>
      <li>Step 4.6: Once you have all of the finished webpages in the repository in your IDE, it's time to publish!</li>
      <li>Step 4.7: Open the GitHub desktop app again.  The updates you've made to the repository (files added or editted) should be listed already.</li>
      <li>Step 4.8: Add a title and description to the update if you choose</li>
      <li>Step 4.9: Click the blue "Commit to main" button</li>
      <li>Step 4.10: Finally, click the "Push origin" button at the top of the application.  Give it a few minutes, and your page will be public!</li>
      <li>Step 4.11: To check out your finished webpage, type in your repository name into your browser searchbar on any device.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you followed the steps correctly, you should be able to see your page!  Isn't that exciting!  If you can't see it, wait 10 minutes
          and check again.  If it still isn't visible, you've missed a step or instruction.  Is your repository named correctly?</li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Mission Success!</h1>
    <p>
      You now have a space to express yourself digitally!  If you want to have a site that supports more complex function or has more
      server space, you might want to consider migrating to a paid service.  With GitHub pages, you also can't change your domain name.
      However, this page is the perfect jumping-off point for website creation!  You can test out your webpages on different devices,
      experiment with different designs, and learn about what a webpage can do (other than look pretty).  You could choose
      to set your desktop browser to open directly to your page to serve as a directory to your favorite websites, or use your page
      to host your personal blog. It's all up to you.  The internet is now yours to control!

    <h1>FAQ:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Can I add interactivity to the page, such as a forum or message board?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>No, GitHub pages are known as "Static" web pages, which means all changes to the page are made by the client, not visitors
        adding that kind of functionality would mean you need website hosting more powerful than GitHub</li>
      </ul>
      <li>What are some project ideas?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal blog</li>
        <li>Band webpage</li>
        <li>Online encyclopedia</li>
        <li>Visual art gallery</li>
        <li>Digital photo album</li>
        <li>Resume host</li>
        <li>Restaurant review blog</li>
        <li>Hub for your social media links</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Will I have to renew my website?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>No, GitHub will host your webpage for as long as you need</li>
      </ul>
      <li>I'm new to writing HTML.  Is it worth it to have a website if it's going to be basic?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Totally!  Experimenting with HTML & CSS is the best way to learn.  It's better to have a simple page to start with,
          then add in parts as you learn about them.  That way, over time, you can visualize how your web design skills have improved!</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Are there people who will make my webpage for me?</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Yes, but for a simplified wepage hosting service like GitHub, hiring someone to design a beautiful webpage is a bit...overkill.
          If you want to make money from your site, hiring a professional web developer and paying for a website hosting service is normal.
            However, GitHub websites are more like personal projects, and hiring someone to design your page would be like putting <thead>
          Mona Lisa in the Dollar General</li>

    <h1>Licensing and Contribution</h1>
    <h2>Licensing</h2>
    <p>
      In your repository, you can choose to include a license.  Your work is yours, and you can decide what people do with it.
      A license is easy to add to your work, and it can be a huge deterrent to people taking your work.  By default, copywrite laws apply
      and no one is allowed to borrow or modify your work.  However, adding licenses allows people more freedom to use your code for their
      own purposes.  There are many different types of licenses, so here are some resources for choosing and applying a license to your work.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href = "https://choosealicense.com/">Here is a resource for helping you find the license that best suits your work</a></li>
      <li><a href = "https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository">
        Here is the GitHub official documentation for including a license in your repository</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Contribution</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub is a free service for most individual users.  However, there are options to upgrade your account for a fee per month.  Some of
      the benefits include upgraded storage space, more control over who can see and change your code, and support from the GitHub team.
      None of these paid services are required to create an account or webpage, but they can be beneficial and support a good company.
