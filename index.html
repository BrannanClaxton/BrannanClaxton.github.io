    <h2>Hi</h2>
    <h2 style="font-family:Arial">This is my blog.  Welcome.  For now, this blog is for my App State
      CS Senior Seminar class this semester, but will likely live on in some
      context in the future.  For now, it it very bare bones, just text on
      a screen, but I plan on adding CSS and more design elements as the semester
      progresses.  Thanks for stopping by!</h2>

    <h1>Entry #1 - 8/20/2021</h1>
    <h2><em>Describe your best "in class" computing experience as a computer science
      student and your best "outside the class" computing experience during your
      time thus far as a computer science student.</em></h2>
    <h3>My best "in class" experience was probably all the way back in CS1400,
       when I had few projects under my belt and printing "hello world" still
       felt really cool.  The lab assignment was to print a stub based on input
       from a console.  It took me so long and I was so frustrated for days, and
       it was the first (of many) moment where I started thinking "do I really want
       to pursue a career where I'm frustrated all the time?"  Finally, however,
       after fiddling with scanners and print statements, I finally tested the
       program one more time and it worked! It printed the whole stub with correct
       format and math done accurately.  I was extatic!  The hours I'd spent sweating
       and banging my head against the wall paid off, and the resulting feeling was
       so much more fulfilling than anything I'd felt before.  I had written code
       before the lab, but it was the first project where I had to use different
       skills together and wasn't hand-held the whole time.  I realized then that,
       no matter how frustrated I would get pursuing CS, the feeling of accomplishment
       will always overshadow the anguish and confusion</h3>
    <h3>My best "outside the class" experience mostly comes from website development
       practice.  Not necessarily one time specifically, but I've had many chill nights
       where I get to just design a canvas how I want and put whatever I want on
       there.  Maybe I'm feeling like making a bigfoot website tonight, so I'd find
       cool graphics and info that I can collage together to make a nice website.
        I get to explore cool interest, work the creative/design aspect of my brain,
        and I still feel like I'm being productive towards my career.  Most of my
        other projects feel like work or homework, or are about things I'm not as
        passionate about, but designing websites has always been a calming, attractive
        activity for me.  This is why I'd like to pursue frontend web dev as a career
        some day.</h3>
