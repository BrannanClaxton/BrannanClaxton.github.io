    <h2>Hi!  This is my blog.  Welcome.  For now, this blog is for my App State
      CS Senior Seminar class this semester, but will likely live on in some
      context in the future.  For now, it it very bare bones, just text on
      a screen, but I plan on adding CSS and more design elements as the semester
      progresses.  Thanks for stopping by!</h2>
