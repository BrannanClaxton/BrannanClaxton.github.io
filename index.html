    <h2 class = "top">Hi</h2>
    <h2 style="font-family:Arial" class="top">This is my blog.  Welcome.  For now, this blog is for my App State
      CS Senior Seminar class this semester, but will likely live on in some
      context in the future. Thanks for stopping by!</h2>

    <h1>Entry #1 - 8/20/2021</h1>
    <h2><em>Describe your best "in class" computing experience as a computer science
      student and your best "outside the class" computing experience during your
      time thus far as a computer science student.</em></h2>
    <h3>My best "in class" experience was probably all the way back in CS1400,
       when I had few projects under my belt and printing "hello world" still
       felt really cool.  The lab assignment was to print a stub based on input
       from a console.  It took me so long and I was so frustrated for days, and
       it was the first (of many) moment where I started thinking "do I really want
       to pursue a career where I'm frustrated all the time?"  Finally, however,
       after fiddling with scanners and print statements, I finally tested the
       program one more time and it worked! It printed the whole stub with correct
       format and math done accurately.  I was extatic!  The hours I'd spent sweating
       and banging my head against the wall paid off, and the resulting feeling was
       so much more fulfilling than anything I'd felt before.  I had written code
       before the lab, but it was the first project where I had to use different
       skills together and wasn't hand-held the whole time.  I realized then that,
       no matter how frustrated I would get pursuing CS, the feeling of accomplishment
       will always overshadow the anguish and confusion</h3>
    <h3>My best "outside the class" experience mostly comes from website development
       practice.  Not necessarily one time specifically, but I've had many chill nights
       where I get to just design a canvas how I want and put whatever I want on
       there.  Maybe I'm feeling like making a bigfoot website tonight, so I'd find
       cool graphics and info that I can collage together to make a nice website.
        I get to explore cool interest, work the creative/design aspect of my brain,
        and I still feel like I'm being productive towards my career.  Most of my
        other projects feel like work or homework, or are about things I'm not as
        passionate about, but designing websites has always been a calming, attractive
        activity for me.  This is why I'd like to pursue frontend web dev as a career
        some day.</h3>

      <h1>Entry #2 - 8/26/2021</h1>
      <h2><em>Make an entry in your blog reflecting on our discussion in class
        about personal ethics.  You might elaborate on things you did not get to
        talk about in class, give your overall impression of the discussion,
        identify the highlights of the discussion, or whatever you think would
        be of interest to others concerning our discussion.</em></h2>
      <h3>While I mentioned my religious background in my ethics presentation,
        I believe it is an important enough aspect of my personality and ethical
        journey that it needs further elaboration.  I grew up in a progressive
        Methodist church to 2 progressive Christian people.  I never spent much
        time thinking about other religions or morality systems, and as many of
        the other students said I tried my best to follow Jesus' teachings and
        the Golden Rule.  However, in my later high school and college years,
        I matured more as a person and gained some perspective.  I began to see
        the Bible as less of the Direct Word of God and more as a book of God-inspired
        poetry that explains a lot about the human experience.  It was also at this
        time that I started researching Buddhism and east Asian religions.  This
        shifted my ethical process from the Golden Rule to more pacifistic mindset.
        Now, instead of "treat others how you'd like to be treated" I am trying to
        treat others like they are me in a different body.  I believe that a lot
        of people reach the wrong side of the Golden Rule, which is that "since
        so-and-so wronged me in some way, they don't deserve my goodwill."  An eye
        for an eye and all that.  The Buddhist perspective is that there is
        suffering in the world, and that the way to reach enlightenment is to remove
        suffering and material attachments.  Therefore, I've done my best to practice
        minimalism and stoicism, which I believe complement Buddhism and therefore
        fit into my ethics system.</h3>
        <h3>One thing that surpised me about our class discussion was how individualistic
        everyone seemed.  Many people described in some way an "every man for himself"
        attitude, where the priority at the end of the day is one's self interest.
        While I respect individuality and everyone's own uniqueness, I find the CS
        field to be incredibly collaborative and community-oriented - every library
        in a programming language was developed by others and most are available
        for use for free.  This is especially true for open-source software.
        Therefore, the fact that so many people referenced having ethics based in
        a "do what's best for me" mindset was pretty interesting and a little
        offputting.  I believe in the open, free sharing of information and ideas
        and working towards the betterment of the world, so an ethical ideology
        that only benefits yourself does not hold up well in my eyes.</h3>

      <h1>Entry #3 - 9/6/21</h1>
      <h2><em>Share thoughts about the presentation and discussion of the Hive
        Tracks and Bee Informed Partnership case study</em></h2>
      <h3>The ethical issues people had with the Hive Tracks and Bee Informed
        Partnership were interesting to me because it seemed like the split people
        felt between privacy, security, and intellectural property issues was pretty
        even.  The class fell pretty neatly into the three different categories
        of ethics issues.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Overall, I think thought that there weren't too many issues with Hive Tracks
        or the Partnership.  Once the groups met and the ethical issues were raised,
        I thought that you (Dr. Wilkes) were pretty easily able to answer issues
        that the class had. Any worries I had about the projects were nonexistent
        after the class had ended.  And, even if there were some ethical issues that
        still need to be worked out, I think that the good that the project does
        overshadows any theoretical problems.  However, I still think that the issues
        my group (privacy) brought up were still pretty valid.  For example, I think
        that the concept of bees being used a biosensors for property outside the
        beekeepers' could raise flags.  Even if the data collected from the bees
        isn't incredibly specific and couldn't be used to scan a person's land,
        people with property nearby could still be paranoid about the bees' sensing
        ability.  My friend Sierra Doughtery who is an Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental
        Science (EEE) major was talking to me about how bees have amazing facial
        recognition abilities that come from an evolutionary skill for recognizing
        flowers.  It may not be a field that Hive Tracks is attempting to enter
        specifically, but it's an example of how people's perception of bee behavior
        could make them more paranoid and therefore reject Hive Tracks based on
        a privacy argument.

      <h1>Entry #4 - 9/21/21</h1>
      <h2><em>Make an entry in your blog describing your reaction to the
        information presented in the documentary Citizenfour? Did the documentary
        have an effect on your opinion of Edward Snowden or the US government?</em></h2>
      <h3>I'd heard from Edward Snowden years ago on the Joe Rogan podcast.  He
        came on to talk about some of the same stuff he described in the documentary,
        such as the PRISM program and other government overreaching organizations.
        He also talked about some of his responsibilities in Hawaii and when he
        finally decided to bite the bullet and release the info.  I remember being
        suprised by how much classified information he had access to even though
        he was just a systems administrator.  The podcast made me aware of the US
        Government's privacy violations and since then I actively followed the story
        involving Snowden and Julian Assange.  I was grossed out at the time and
        I feel even more so now.  I believe strongly in anonymity online on both
        sides.  I don't like to post much personal information online and I don't
        appreciate internet companies recording personal information.  I think that
        the internet works best when people can share ideas without their name or
        identifing information attached, so that people will base their responses
        off of the information provided instead of the person making the argument.
        This is the free market of ideas.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        The documentary was very interesting to me because it provided more of a
        view of Ed's personal life after leaking the documents.  While I read about
        him being "on the run" and being searched for by the government, I didn't
        get as good a view of how it really affected him and how stressful the situation
        was for him.  I was especially angry after seeing Obama's statement on behalf
        of "the American People." While I liked Obama's presidency and overall had
        a favorable view of him, I strongly disliked how dismissive he was of Snowden's
        position and the need for transparency in the government.  I think he should've
        pardoned Snowden and Assange.  One idea that I was left with after finishing
        the documentary was that the government needs to have more systems of checks
        and balances.  I think the founding fathers were smart in creating the balance
        between the different branches of government, but we've moved drastically
        away from that system.  It's apparent that the NSA had no one to tell them
        "no," and once Snowden leaked the documents he had no possible way to defend
        himself legally.  I'm not anti-government, but I think there's a way to create
        some kind of new system of checks and balances to make sure that no single
        government organization can be granted the power the NSA has to use our own
        technology systems against us.  I believe that this could be accomplished
        by bringing in an unbiased 3rd party committee, possibly from another country
        or the UN, to go through the PRISM system and other NSA surveillance equipment and
        make a judgement on whether it's constitutional and morally right.  Whatever
        suggestions they make the NSA has to accept unconditionally, and if the NSA's
        actions are too heinous to be fixed, the organization should be dismantled
        and the confidential information made public.  Overall, the documentary made
        me feel strongly for Snowden and made me think more critically of the government.
