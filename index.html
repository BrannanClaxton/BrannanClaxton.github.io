    <h2 class = "top">Hi</h2>
    <h2 style="font-family:Arial" class="top">This is my blog.  Welcome.  For now, this blog is for my App State
      CS Senior Seminar class this semester, but will likely live on in some
      context in the future. Thanks for stopping by!</h2>

    <h1>Entry #1 - 8/20/2021</h1>
    <h2><em>Describe your best "in class" computing experience as a computer science
      student and your best "outside the class" computing experience during your
      time thus far as a computer science student.</em></h2>
    <h3>My best "in class" experience was probably all the way back in CS1400,
       when I had few projects under my belt and printing "hello world" still
       felt really cool.  The lab assignment was to print a stub based on input
       from a console.  It took me so long and I was so frustrated for days, and
       it was the first (of many) moment where I started thinking "do I really want
       to pursue a career where I'm frustrated all the time?"  Finally, however,
       after fiddling with scanners and print statements, I finally tested the
       program one more time and it worked! It printed the whole stub with correct
       format and math done accurately.  I was extatic!  The hours I'd spent sweating
       and banging my head against the wall paid off, and the resulting feeling was
       so much more fulfilling than anything I'd felt before.  I had written code
       before the lab, but it was the first project where I had to use different
       skills together and wasn't hand-held the whole time.  I realized then that,
       no matter how frustrated I would get pursuing CS, the feeling of accomplishment
       will always overshadow the anguish and confusion</h3>
    <h3>My best "outside the class" experience mostly comes from website development
       practice.  Not necessarily one time specifically, but I've had many chill nights
       where I get to just design a canvas how I want and put whatever I want on
       there.  Maybe I'm feeling like making a bigfoot website tonight, so I'd find
       cool graphics and info that I can collage together to make a nice website.
        I get to explore cool interest, work the creative/design aspect of my brain,
        and I still feel like I'm being productive towards my career.  Most of my
        other projects feel like work or homework, or are about things I'm not as
        passionate about, but designing websites has always been a calming, attractive
        activity for me.  This is why I'd like to pursue frontend web dev as a career
        some day.</h3>

      <h1>Entry #2 - 8/26/2021</h1>
      <h2><em>Make an entry in your blog reflecting on our discussion in class
        about personal ethics.  You might elaborate on things you did not get to
        talk about in class, give your overall impression of the discussion,
        identify the highlights of the discussion, or whatever you think would
        be of interest to others concerning our discussion.</em></h2>
      <h3>While I mentioned my religious background in my ethics presentation,
        I believe it is an important enough aspect of my personality and ethical
        journey that it needs further elaboration.  I grew up in a progressive
        Methodist church to 2 progressive Christian people.  I never spent much
        time thinking about other religions or morality systems, and as many of
        the other students said I tried my best to follow Jesus' teachings and
        the Golden Rule.  However, in my later high school and college years,
        I matured more as a person and gained some perspective.  I began to see
        the Bible as less of the Direct Word of God and more as a book of God-inspired
        poetry that explains a lot about the human experience.  It was also at this
        time that I started researching Buddhism and east Asian religions.  This
        shifted my ethical process from the Golden Rule to more pacifistic mindset.
        Now, instead of "treat others how you'd like to be treated" I am trying to
        treat others like they are me in a different body.  I believe that a lot
        of people reach the wrong side of the Golden Rule, which is that "since
        so-and-so wronged me in some way, they don't deserve my goodwill."  An eye
        for an eye and all that.  The Buddhist perspective is that there is
        suffering in the world, and that the way to reach enlightenment is to remove
        suffering and material attachments.  Therefore, I've done my best to practice
        minimalism and stoicism, which I believe complement Buddhism and therefore
        fit into my ethics system.</h3>
        <h3>One thing that surpised me about our class discussion was how individualistic
        everyone seemed.  Many people described in some way an "every man for himself"
        attitude, where the priority at the end of the day is one's self interest.
        While I respect individuality and everyone's own uniqueness, I find the CS
        field to be incredibly collaborative and community-oriented - every library
        in a programming language was developed by others and most are available
        for use for free.  This is especially true for open-source software.
        Therefore, the fact that so many people referenced having ethics based in
        a "do what's best for me" mindset was pretty interesting and a little
        offputting.  I believe in the open, free sharing of information and ideas
        and working towards the betterment of the world, so an ethical ideology
        that only benefits yourself does not hold up well in my eyes.</h3>

      <h1>Entry #3 - 9/6/21</h1>
      <h2><em>Share thoughts about the presentation and discussion of the Hive
        Tracks and Bee Informed Partnership case study</em></h2>
      <h3>The ethical issues people had with the Hive Tracks and Bee Informed
        Partnership were interesting to me because it seemed like the split people
        felt between privacy, security, and intellectural property issues was pretty
        even.  The class fell pretty neatly into the three different categories
        of ethics issues.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Overall, I think thought that there weren't too many issues with Hive Tracks
        or the Partnership.  Once the groups met and the ethical issues were raised,
        I thought that you (Dr. Wilkes) were pretty easily able to answer issues
        that the class had. Any worries I had about the projects were nonexistent
        after the class had ended.  And, even if there were some ethical issues that
        still need to be worked out, I think that the good that the project does
        overshadows any theoretical problems.  However, I still think that the issues
        my group (privacy) brought up were still pretty valid.  For example, I think
        that the concept of bees being used a biosensors for property outside the
        beekeepers' could raise flags.  Even if the data collected from the bees
        isn't incredibly specific and couldn't be used to scan a person's land,
        people with property nearby could still be paranoid about the bees' sensing
        ability.  My friend Sierra Doughtery who is an Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental
        Science (EEE) major was talking to me about how bees have amazing facial
        recognition abilities that come from an evolutionary skill for recognizing
        flowers.  It may not be a field that Hive Tracks is attempting to enter
        specifically, but it's an example of how people's perception of bee behavior
        could make them more paranoid and therefore reject Hive Tracks based on
        a privacy argument.

      <h1>Entry #4 - 9/21/21</h1>
      <h2><em>Make an entry in your blog describing your reaction to the
        information presented in the documentary Citizenfour? Did the documentary
        have an effect on your opinion of Edward Snowden or the US government?</em></h2>
      <h3>I'd heard from Edward Snowden years ago on the Joe Rogan podcast.  He
        came on to talk about some of the same stuff he described in the documentary,
        such as the PRISM program and other government overreaching organizations.
        He also talked about some of his responsibilities in Hawaii and when he
        finally decided to bite the bullet and release the info.  I remember being
        suprised by how much classified information he had access to even though
        he was just a systems administrator.  The podcast made me aware of the US
        Government's privacy violations and since then I actively followed the story
        involving Snowden and Julian Assange.  I was grossed out at the time and
        I feel even more so now.  I believe strongly in anonymity online on both
        sides.  I don't like to post much personal information online and I don't
        appreciate internet companies recording personal information.  I think that
        the internet works best when people can share ideas without their name or
        identifing information attached, so that people will base their responses
        off of the information provided instead of the person making the argument.
        This is the free market of ideas.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        The documentary was very interesting to me because it provided more of a
        view of Ed's personal life after leaking the documents.  While I read about
        him being "on the run" and being searched for by the government, I didn't
        get as good a view of how it really affected him and how stressful the situation
        was for him.  I was especially angry after seeing Obama's statement on behalf
        of "the American People." While I liked Obama's presidency and overall had
        a favorable view of him, I strongly disliked how dismissive he was of Snowden's
        position and the need for transparency in the government.  I think he should've
        pardoned Snowden and Assange.  One idea that I was left with after finishing
        the documentary was that the government needs to have more systems of checks
        and balances.  I think the founding fathers were smart in creating the balance
        between the different branches of government, but we've moved drastically
        away from that system.  It's apparent that the NSA had no one to tell them
        "no," and once Snowden leaked the documents he had no possible way to defend
        himself legally.  I'm not anti-government, but I think there's a way to create
        some kind of new system of checks and balances to make sure that no single
        government organization can be granted the power the NSA has to use our own
        technology systems against us.  I believe that this could be accomplished
        by bringing in an unbiased 3rd party committee, possibly from another country
        or the UN, to go through the PRISM system and other NSA surveillance equipment and
        make a judgement on whether it's constitutional and morally right.  Whatever
        suggestions they make the NSA has to accept unconditionally, and if the NSA's
        actions are too heinous to be fixed, the organization should be dismantled
        and the confidential information made public.  Overall, the documentary made
        me feel strongly for Snowden and made me think more critically of the government.

      <h1>Entry #5 - 10/3/21</h1>
      <h2><em>Share your reaction to the TED Talks on Privacy or the exercises this
        week on privacy policies.</em></h2>
      <h3>
        A lot of the discussions we had in class and the videos we watched made me
        overall very uncomfortable.  The whole concept of "passive surveillance,"
        where everyone's digital data is monitored in the search for a few "criminals"
        communicating online, seems like an overstep by the government to me.  Authoritarian
        groups have always had a history of wanting to monitor the communications
        and actions of the average person, and internet surveillance has only given
        those in power the tools to gather more data and learn more about the habits
        and behaviors of regular people.  All of this is not new information to me,
        since I and most of my generation have grown up in this modern surveillance
        society.  We have all learned early that nothing online is truly "private,"
        and I think it has taught many members of my generation that they must find
        alternative methods to continue to use online services safely.  I believe
        that public schools were the first introduction on how to be truly private
        online.  I learned how to install a VPN on my laptop in my freshman year
        of high school to get around the monitoring system in place, and even in
        middle school my friends figured out how to get "teacher access" on the school
        computers so that we could get onto blocked sites like YouTube and game websites.
        So, while some people are recently learning that their internet activites
        are being monitored, I don't believe anyone around my age is surprised.
        Even if the website I use isn't tracking me, I still assume that my Wifi
        provider, local authorities, or the NSA is watching every single thing I do
        online.  This isn't news to me, this is the environment I grew up in.  It's
        slightly ironic to me that we are learning about privacy violations from a
        University that monitors their students internet activitites for "safety"
        purposes.  I know that you don't have anything to do with these decisions,
        Dr. Wilkes, but the fact that we're about being taught about privacy from
        the same academic entity that doesn't have any concerns about the privacy
        of their students is pretty gross to me.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        While I don't think the government or any organization should be monitoring
        the actions of normal folk online, I also don't think that these groups are
        going to stop anytime soon out of the kindness of their hearts.  The NSA
        has enough power now where they can come up with any "potential danger" that
        will require more surveillance tools and more control.  The only chance that
        we have to protect ourself and our privacy is to take matters into our own
        hands through encryption software and VPNs.  We can't rely on the government
        protect our privacy, so we need to learn how to do it ourselves.  I think
        that soon more privacy-enforcing software will be widely available and become
        more popular.  It's our own responsibility to protect ourselves from surveillance.

      <h1>Entry #6 - 10/8/21</h1>
        <h2>Make an entry in your blog discussing the most interesting thing you
          learned as a result of the blockchain videos/discussions.<h2>
        <h3>
          While I'd heard about the blockchain in the past in relation to bitcoin,
          I never attempted to fully understand it and its uses outside of cryptocurrency.
          The links people shared to the class Wiki were technical and informative,
          and I learned a lot about the science and logic behind the development of
          blockchain technology in its base form.  I then did some more exploration
          of the topic on my own into possible applications of the blockchain,
          specifically NFTs.  One of my favorite YouTubers, Johnny Harris, made a
          video recently titled "NFTs, Explained" which gives an overview of what
          an NFT represents and the logic behind the "fungible-nonfungible" difference.
          This concept really blew my mind, because it's strange to think about
          someone paying large amounts of money for things that can be replicated
          infinitely.  Johnny Harris also links this topic and the financial logic
          behind these transactions to the Blockchain.  At this point I was familiar
          with blockchain technology but the way that it was contextualized with
          a practical application like an NFT changed my perspective of how the blockchain
          could be used.  Other than its use in cryptocurrency, the blockchain always
          seemed like one of those discoveries that was cool in theory but lacked
          a real use for the average person.  I'm starting to believe that we are
          just beginning to discover what Blockchain technology could create.
      </h3>
      <h3>
          I'm very supportive of new technology that is free to access and works
          collaboratively.  I think that the future of the internet will be more decentralized
          and less structured.  This technology can work well precisely because there's
          no core group "in charge."  It works because people have faith in each
          other as a whole rather than one single entity, like a bank or a government.
          Blockchain technology is decentralized at its center.  It relies on people
          trusting the collaborative ledger.  And it works without an "overseer."
          I think more of our day-to-day life will be influenced be "decentralized"
          processes.  For example, I think that we would benefit from using blockchain
          technology in the voting system or in data integrity in general.  There
          are infinite applications and I think that it will be understood by many
          more people in the near future.
      </h3>
    <hr>
    <h1>Entry #7 - 11/3/21</h1>
      <h2>
        Now that you have heard the ideas that people are considering for their
        final project, make a blog post describing the final topic you are most
        interested in hearing more about and why.
      </h2>
      <h3>
        Many of the topics I'm most interested are related to crypto and decentralization
        in general.  While there is a lot to learn about that space, I'm more
        interested in the ethical and social application of DeFi and tokenization.
        I think the way we exchange value for goods and services will change a lot
        over the next few years, and while I'm interested in specific coins and tokens
        I'm more excited to see the presentations that have a wider perspective and
        are going to dive into ways our day-to-day lives will change.  I can't remember
        who chose it, but one of the topics that stood out to me was about DeFi specifically.
        I think a lot of the issues in our world, such as poverty and hunger, stem
        from a supply chain failure, mostly due to corporate greed.  Businesses like
        banks hold a majority of the wealth and value in the world simply because
        they quickly consolidated power and were able to profit off of those trying
        to just get by in the world.  The US is arguably the most financially powerful
        country in the world, and most of that wealth came from the ability to centralize
        that power within a few corporations and government entities to the detriment
        of smaller countries with fewer resources.  I think that a lot of the ideas
        we've talked about in this class, such as privacy, are tools for overcoming
        the power of these entities and returning value to the indvidual in a decentralized
        way.  Whoever is presenting on DeFi technology has a lot of work to do just
        to scratch the surface of this complex topic, but I think that whatever they
        discover will be quite illuminating.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Overall, I think most of the presentations will be interesting.  Any project
        where students are allowed to be pretty free with their topic choices end
        up way more interesting than assigned topics.  I have been taking a philosophy
        class this semester and I'm really interested in combining it with topics
        from this class in my presentation of the ethics of social media platforms.
      </h3>
